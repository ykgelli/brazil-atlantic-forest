# About
This directory gathers the scripts used in MapBiomas collections for mapping land use and land cover classes in the Atlantic forest biome. They are divided by the source of satellite imagery (Landsat or Sentinel) and by data collections. It is always recommended to use the most recent collection (highest number) to replicate the steps.

Questions and suggestions can be forwarded to the development team: mrosa@arcplan.com.br
